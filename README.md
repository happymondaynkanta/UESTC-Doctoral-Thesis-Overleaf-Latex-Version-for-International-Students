# UESTC-Doctoral-Thesis-Overleaf-Latex-Version-for-International-Students
This is the Overleaf Latex version of UESTC Doctoral Thesis for International PhD students who wish to format their final dissertation using overleaf latex template rather than word template which comes with so much setbacks.

# Short brief
UESTC Thesis in overleaf latex version for doctoral International Students. The UESTC Thesis overleaf version available to postgraduate International Students has been repeatedly reported to have some bugs by the students and which makes it difficult for international students to cope with the required format. Issues like wrong page numbering, interference between roman and arabic numbering, inconsistent page header and unnecessary blank pages. In this repository, I have addressed all those bugs, and re-organized the UESTC Thesis overleaf latex version to suit the requirement for doctoral dissertation format.
