abstract = {This paper presents a new selection-based question answering dataset, SelQA. The dataset consists of questions generated through crowdsourcing and sentence length answers that are drawn from the ten most prevalent topics in the English Wikipedia. We introduce a corpus annotation scheme that enhances the generation of large, diverse, and challenging datasets by explicitly aiming to reduce word co-occurrences between the question and answers. Our annotation scheme is composed of a series of crowdsourcing tasks with a view to more effectively utilize crowdsourcing in the creation of question answering datasets in various domains. Several systems are compared on the tasks of answer sentence selection and answer triggering, providing strong baseline results for future work to improve upon.},

abstract = {We describe the WIKIQA dataset, a new publicly available set of question and sen-tence pairs, collected and annotated for re-search on open-domain question answer-ing. Most previous work on answer sen-tence selection focuses on a dataset cre-ated using the TREC-QA data, which includes editor-generated questions and candidate answer sentences selected by matching content words in the question. WIKIQA is constructed using a more nat-ural process and is more than an order of magnitude larger than the previous dataset. In addition, the WIKIQA dataset also in-cludes questions for which there are no correct sentences, enabling researchers to work on answer triggering, a critical com-ponent in any QA system. We compare several systems on the task of answer sen-tence selection on both datasets and also describe the performance of a system on the problem of answer triggering using the WIKIQA dataset.},
